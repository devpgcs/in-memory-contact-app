# Requirements:

- [x] Users should be able to view a list of their contacts.
- [] Users should be able to add contacts to the list. For each contact, a name is mandatory, but a contact cannot solely consist of a name; it must include either a phone number, an email, or both.
- [x] Users should be able to view alongside the list:
  - A counter displaying the total number of contacts with a phone number.
  - A counter displaying the total number of contacts with an email.

The solution should not utilize global state in a parent component passing state down to children as props; instead, a technique for state sharing between components should be employed.

# Considerations:

- [x] No connection to an external API is required.
- [x] The application must be functional and user-friendly, with a clear and concise user interface.
- [x] Proper use of React components and code organization will be appreciated.
